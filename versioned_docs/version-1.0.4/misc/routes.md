# Routing

This is used in making single page applications, literally with only one HTML page. When the user makes a request for a new page like `/about` , The router would remove the "current page" and display the about page information on the same HTML page.

:::info
 The `velte-starter-kit` for `velte 1.0.4` doesn't come with a SPA router out of the box, a third party library would be required.
