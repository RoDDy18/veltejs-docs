## Velte Components

Velte components can be authored in two different ways `classes` and `functions`. For example we have `<GettingStarted/>` created as a `Function Component` and `Class Component` below:

### Function Component

```jsx title="GettingStarted.jsx"
import {VelteElement} from "velte"

function GettingStarted() {
    return(
        <div className="card">
            <h2 className="title"><i className="fas fa-book"></i> Getting Started</h2>
            <p>You should read the documentation, it covers every bit of the library.</p>
            <a href="#" v-attr:role="button" className="button">Read the Docs</a>
        </div>
    )
}
```

### Class Component

```jsx title="GettingStarted.jsx"
import {VelteComponent,VelteElement} from "velte"

class GettingStarted extends VelteComponent{
    constructor(){
        this.state = {}
    }

    render(){
        return(
            <div className="card">
                <h2 className="title"><i className="fas fa-book"></i> Getting Started</h2>
                <p>You should read the documentation, it covers every bit of the library.</p>
                <a href="#" v-attr:role="button" className="button">Read the Docs</a>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```
